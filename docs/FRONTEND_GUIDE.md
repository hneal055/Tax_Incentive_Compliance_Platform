# Frontend UI Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the frontend user interface of the PilotForge platform.

## Dashboard
The Dashboard serves as the primary landing page, providing users with an overview of their key metrics and performance indicators. It should display:
- User-specific data visualizations (charts, graphs)
- Quick access links to other areas of the platform
- Notifications or announcements relevant to the user

## Productions Page
The Productions page allows users to manage production-related data. Key features include:
- A searchable list of productions
- Filters to narrow down results (by date, status, etc.)
- Detailed view of each production upon selection

## Jurisdictions Page
This page helps users navigate the various jurisdictions relevant to tax incentives. Important elements include:
- A map view displaying jurisdictions
- Lists of benefits and requirements per jurisdiction
- User-friendly filtering options to find specific information

## Calculator Page
The Calculator page is designed to assist users in estimating tax benefits. Elements include:
- Input fields for various parameters affecting calculations
- Real-time calculation display based on user input
- Clear explanations of each calculation field

## Navigation Elements
- **Top Navigation Bar:** Contains links to main sections of the platform (Dashboard, Productions, Jurisdictions, Calculator).
- **Side Navigation Menu:** Offers quick access to sub-sections within the currently selected main page.
- **Breadcrumb Navigation:** Helps users track their location within the platform.

## Loading States
- Loading indicators (spinners/bars) should be displayed when fetching data or transitioning between pages.
- Placeholders should be used when the data is loading, to give users an idea of what to expect.

## Error States
- Friendly error messages should be shown for any issues encountered by the user.
- Offer solutions or next steps when an error occurs (e.g., retry, contact support).

## Responsive Design
- The UI should adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, utilizing a mobile-first approach.
- Key elements must be easy to access and readable on all devices.

## Accessibility Features
- Ensure keyboard navigability across all components.
- Implement ARIA roles and attributes for assistive technologies.
- Color contrast should meet accessibility standards for readability.

This document will be updated regularly to reflect changes in the UI design and features.
