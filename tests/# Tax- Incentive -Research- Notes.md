## **CRITICAL BOUNDARIES:**

### **✅ DO:**
- Spend 2-3 hours max
- Create simple reference notes
- Focus on understanding the problem space
- Use this to ask BETTER questions on Monday
- Take notes on what you DON'T understand (ask Eric!)

### **❌ DON'T:**
- Build a comprehensive database of all 32+ jurisdictions
- Create spreadsheets with all requirements
- Build any code or tools
- Spend more than 3 hours
- Try to become an expert
- Create the actual product database

---

## **WHY THIS IS OKAY:**

**Customer discovery is better when you:**
- ✅ Understand basic terminology
- ✅ Can reference specific programs
- ✅ Ask informed questions
- ✅ Show you've done homework

**But it's worse when you:**
- ❌ Think you know more than customers
- ❌ Have already decided the solution
- ❌ Ask leading questions
- ❌ Don't listen because you're "the expert"

**2-3 hours of research = informed questions**  
**20 hours of research = confirmation bias**

## **YOUR WEEKEND PLAN:**

**FRIDAY EVENING (2-3 hours):**
- ✅ Research Phase 1: Landscape (1 hour)
- ✅ Research Phase 2: 3 jurisdictions (1 hour)
- ✅ Research Phase 3: Recent news (30 min)
- ✅ Create reference doc (30 min)

**SATURDAY:**
- ✅ Comment on 3-5 posts in Film Tax Incentives LinkedIn group
- ✅ Review your interview questions
- ✅ Practice asking them out loud

**SUNDAY:**
- ✅ Review Eric call prep
- ✅ Make sure note-taking doc is ready
- ✅ Review your research notes
- ✅ Prepare 2-3 specific questions based on research

**MONDAY MORNING:**
- ✅ Call Eric
- ✅ Use research to ask better questions
- ✅ LISTEN more than you talk
- ✅ Take detailed notes

---

## **THE KEY MINDSET:**

**You're researching to ASK better questions, not to TELL Eric what the solution should be.**

**Good use of research in Eric call:**
```
"I was reading about Georgia's recent changes to the labor requirement threshold - have you dealt with that? How did it impact your workflow?"
```

**Bad use of research:**
```
"I've researched all 32 jurisdictions and I think the solution needs X, Y, Z features. What do you think?"
